# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Development Approach

**Technical Stack:**
- This project is built using React for the frontend.
- Redux is used for state management to handle the character data, search, and sort functionality.
- React Router used for navigation between views.

**Folder Structure:**
- Components are organized into separate folders for better code organization.
- Redux actions, reducers, and store setup are in the `reducer` and `action` folder.
- API calls are made using the `axios` API.
- Styling of the table is done using the Material UI.

**Features:**
- Implemented core features like fetching, searching, sorting, and detail view.
- Additional bonus features such as Redux state management.

## Challenges and Solutions

**Challenge 1: API Integration**
- Fetching data from the "Rick and Morty" API presented challenges like handling async actions.
- Solution: Implemented asynchronous actions and manage API calls using axios.

**Challenge 2: State Management**
- Managing application state and keeping it in sync with Redux presented a learning curve.
- Solution: Designed clear actions and reducers, organized code, and used Redux DevTools for debugging.

**Challenge 3: Styling**
- Creating a visually appealing user interface required thought and design decisions.
